  emulate.py will download the ERA5 data for each hour between start_time and end_time and save it locally.
  It will then run the ML emulation tool on that data after preprocessing it and save it to disc.
  Required arguments:
  - start_time (str): The starting time you would like to emulate. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format.
  - end_time (str): The starting time you would like to emulate. Must be in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format.

  For lower level configuration, see the config/ directory.
  - data.yaml specifies input data file paths
  - query.yaml specifies the query to be made to the CDS API and Comet for the raw ML model
  - statistics.yaml specifies the statistics used to preprocess the data (and thus reconstruct the original data)
